    <font size="5">This 
    is bassist Mike Nigrin's site, and I'm currently on the <b>ballot 
    for</b> <b>Executive Board</b> member in the upcoming <b>Local 92 A.F. of M<i>.</i></b> 
    elections, <b>November 3rd, 2023</b>. I've been a member of the bass 
    section of YOUR <b>Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra</b> now for 30 years, 
    lol. It always struck me as funny when they refer to the orchestra as YOUR 
    BPO. It's really OUR BPO, everyone included. In all seriousness, it's a 
    real privilege to perform with the orchestra as it's never sounded better. 
    For what it&#8217;s worth, it sounded good 30 years ago, but it's even better 
    now. COVID was especially hard on our industry, with the graduating 
    students in music schools bearing an overwhelming burden because of it. 
    That's perhaps why the level of talent we are getting at the national 
    auditions is so high, simply because there are several years of 
    bottlenecked talent competing for these scarce jobs.<br><br>It's a tough 
    industry, no doubt, and I've experienced the good, the bad and the ugly. 
    I've stared down the abyss of orchestra bankruptcies early on in my career 
    and saw what it took to self-manage an orchestra from scratch. I also 
    worked under a non-union contract abroad in Sao Paulo, Brazil and I can 
    say it wasn't pretty. Don't get me wrong, the <b>Orquestra Symphonica Do 
    Estado de Sao Paulo</b>, (OSESP) was a fantastic orchestra with great 
    players, but I also witnessed a harpist once getting terminated by the 
    conductor, on-the-spot, in front of the entire orchestra. Ok, perhaps the 
    standard was not up to par, however, it was shocking to me that this 
    person's dignity was denied like that. My heart was racing during the 
    entire episode, not a good feeling. I remember telling principal cellist 
    Roman Mekinulov in Sao Paulo about the BPO and that he should 'check it 
    out'. I was surprised shortly thereafter when I got a phone call from him 
    saying he was going to do exactly that. I didn't think he would take me 
    seriously, but here he is, a great asset to the community not only with 
    his remarkable cello performances but also, with his contribution to the 
    education of our youth with his &#8216;Bravo&#8217; music camps.<br><br>I've 
    always had a soft spot for the underdog. Maybe that's why I live in 
    Buffalo. :-) When I was under a lockout situation with the New Orleans 
    Symphony, I got a call to write the music for a political documentary 
    pointing out the differences in sentencing applied based on race entitled '<b>Double 
    Justice, Race and Capital Punishment'</b> which was presented before 
    members of Congress. It was on-topic of 'justice and equity' before that 
    was even on any agenda, way back in 1990.<br><br>I don't usually go with 
    the trends but rather follow my own heart. You may have seen me in the 
    news lately as the spokesperson/organizer of the '<b>Stop The Metro</b>' 
    campaign. Our petition is currently at over 2,000 signatures since May and 
    still growing. No, we don't want to actually stop the metro rail, but 
    rather the extension proposal into Amherst. Again, I feel for the 
    community and the destruction that it would bring to home and businesses 
    along the route of the proposed rail. I see the lack or ridership that 
    currently exists and also recognize that big influences are pushing for 
    those short-term federal dollars, and the little folks (area family-owned 
    businesses) would get crushed and county residents levied with more 
    transit taxes long-term, even though there isn't a demonstrable need for 
    rail and expanded bus would serve the community just fine. I've gotten 
    emails threatening physical violence and have been called derogatory names 
    publicly, all on account of this. CRAZY!<br><br>I'm also on my HOA board 
    of 82 units. I always 'listen' to our community members and give them the 
    benefit of the doubt until proven otherwise, and understand the importance 
    of coming to consensus and being amenable all through the process, but 
    also not shy to call someone or something out.<br><br>I have three 
    advanced education degrees, two in music performance, and one in computer 
    engineering and run my own data mining business on top of performing with 
    the Buffalo Philharmonic as well as the Sarasota Orchestra (part time).<br><br>If 
    there's any issues that concern you about OUR Local, or have questions, or 
    just want to chat, please feel free to send an email 
    using the contact info down below my signature.<br><br>Thanks for reading, 
    and all the best!<br><br>Regards,<br><b>Michael Nigrin<br>mnigrin@michaelnigrin.info</b></font><br><br><img height="245" width="400" src="mikeperf.jpg">
